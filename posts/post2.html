                <p class="text-gray-100 mb-8 text-xl leading-relaxed font-light">The second week of our project was
                    marked by a pivotal meeting with stakeholders, particularly with representatives from institutions
                    directly involved in the healthcare sector. This meeting was crucial as it not only validated our
                    proposed solution but also facilitated a valuable exchange of knowledge, allowing us to identify
                    concrete challenges and establish a clear direction for the next phases of development.

                    <h2 class="text-[#00DF82] font-semibold mb-6 text-3xl border-b border-gray-800 pb-2">Presentation of
                        the Proposed Solution
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-100 text-lg leading-relaxed">During the meeting, we had the opportunity to
                        present in detail our dynamic monitoring solution for triage in emergency units. Although we
                        already had a well-structured concept of what we intended to develop, the presentation and
                        discussion with stakeholders unveiled new perspectives that enriched our proposal. The interest
                        was immediate, particularly regarding the transformative potential of integrating smart sensors
                        into the emergency triage process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 text-lg leading-relaxed">The feedback on our proposal was extremely
                        positive, with a strong emphasis on its ability to reduce human error, accelerate triage
                        processes, and optimize responses to critical patients. However, it became evident that
                        implementing new technologies in hospital environments requires careful adaptation and seamless
                        integration with existing emergency unit systems. This insight was crucial, allowing us to
                        refine our solution to ensure greater alignment with real operational demands.

                            necessary technical support throughout the project. We were offered substantial assistance,
                            including access to currently used equipment to ensure proper calibration of our sensors and
                            the
                            opportunity to conduct tests in hospital environments. This support will be essential for
                            validating our solution, enabling the collection of real data and continuous feedback during
                            the
