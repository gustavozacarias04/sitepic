                    align our system with real-world clinical practices. Recently, the doctors advising us recommended a

                            assessing and prioritizing patients and defined as “the process of sorting people in need of

                        An effective triage system must balance speed, accuracy, and resource allocation. It must enable
                        healthcare providers to quickly assess a patient's condition, determine the urgency of care
                        required, and assign an appropriate level of priority. To achieve this, triage systems rely on
                        standardized criteria that guide decision-making and ensure consistency across different
                        hospitals and regions.

                        The acuity measurement component of triage refers to how severe a patient's condition is, based
                        on observable symptoms and clinical risk factors. Different triage scales classify patients into
                        priority levels, ensuring that resources such as medical staff, equipment, and hospital beds are
                        allocated effectively.

                        In the NHS, triage is structured and follows specific guidelines. The system aims to minimize
                        wait times, optimize patient flow, and ensure that emergency care is delivered efficiently. Some
                        hospitals also use digital triage tools, which help assess patients before they even arrive at
                        the hospital, reducing congestion and allowing staff to prepare for incoming cases.

                        standardize the triage process. Its structured approach ensures that patients are categorized

                        To improve the effectiveness of our system, we have been researching other triage models used
                        internationally. Two of the most prominent systems are the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) used
                        in the United States and the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) used in Canada.

                        The ESI is a five-level triage system similar to MTS but with a stronger focus on resource
                        utilization. Instead of only considering the urgency of the patient’s condition, ESI also
                        evaluates how many hospital resources will be required to treat the patient.

                        presentations to determine priority.
