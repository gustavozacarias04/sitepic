                    MAX30102, a highly efficient optical sensor designed for non-invasive measurement of vital signs.
                    Its compact design, low power consumption, and high accuracy make it an ideal choice for wearable
                    medical applications, particularly in emergency settings where continuous monitoring and immediate

                        light through the skin and measuring the light absorption caused by blood flow variations.
                        Several factors made this sensor the perfect fit for our system:

                        treatment can lead to severe complications, including condition deterioration, prolonged
                        hospital stays, or even escalation to a more critical state.

                        CTAS, like MTS, uses five levels to classify patient urgency, but it incorporates more detailed
                        clinical criteria. The system relies on symptom-based guidelines and specific patient
                        presentations to determine priority.
