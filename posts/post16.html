                    recently had the opportunity to present the current status of our emergency triage monitoring system
                    to the Director of the Emergency Department at our partner hospital. This meeting served as a key
                    validation milestone, allowing us to receive clinical feedback directly from a domain expert.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-100 mb-8 text-xl leading-relaxed font-light">Despite the technical issues previously
                    discussed — particularly the sensitivity limitations of the MAX30102 sensor (LINK TO PREVIOUS POST)
                    when worn as a wristband — we decided to move forward with showcasing what we had, acknowledging
                    that time constraints and some promising results warranted early external input.</p>

                        Highlighting the Importance of Blood Pressure</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
                        The feedback on the wristband prototype was positive overall. Its compact form, ability to
                        collect multiple vital signs, and clear role in patient monitoring were well received. However,
                        the Director emphasized the clinical importance of blood pressure monitoring, particularly for
                        triage purposes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4"> While not yet implemented in our current
                        prototype due to its technical complexity, our team has already been researching feasible
                        methods to address this — such as non-invasive blood pressure estimation using
                        photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals and pulse wave analysis.</p>

                        One of the highlights of the feedback session was the application interface. The Director
                        appreciated its simplicity, clarity, and practical functionality. Key points noted included:

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">This setup not only improves usability in
                        dynamic clinical environments but also showcases the flexibility of our system architecture.

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
                        A particularly useful suggestion was the inclusion of user identification for the healthcare
                        professional validating patient data. This feature — aimed at improving traceability and
                        accountability — had already been discussed within our team and is currently under development.

                        ensure that any data verification or edits within the system can be attributed to the
                        responsible medical staff, enhancing both security and reliability.</p>

                        Emergency Department Director</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
                        As a final note during our meeting, the Director of the Emergency Department generously agreed
                        to record a short video message reflecting on the solution we presented. In the video, he shared
                        his thoughts on the relevance of continuous vital sign monitoring during triage and commented
                        positively on the potential of our system to support clinical decision-making in high-pressure
                        scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4"> Although the prototype is still under
                        development, the Director emphasized the importance of early, dynamic information during
                        emergency admissions and how our approach could complement existing processes. His feedback
                        reinforces the clinical value of our project and will be included in our final demonstration as
                        an external perspective from the field.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4"> This kind of engagement helps bridge the gap
                        between academic prototypes and practical hospital applications — an essential step in
                        validating real-world impact.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
                        Despite the known limitations of our prototype, this meeting was a critical validation point.
                        The positive reception of the wristband and app, along with practical suggestions for
                        improvement, confirmed we are on the right track.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
                        Moving forward, our focus will shift to:

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-gray-100 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">The meeting reaffirmed the value of early
                        stakeholder engagement, even when the system is still under development. With their feedback, we
                        are better equipped to align our technological efforts with real clinical needs and correct some
                        of the issues that we may have in our system, before presentation day, making sure that is all
                        working perfectly in ElectroDay (July 5th).
